# CSARCH2-Simulation-Project
## Overview
The cache simulator is an interactive web app designed to emulate a full associative cache memory system with a Most Recently Used (MRU) replacement policy, and a Non-Load-Through read policy.

## System Specifications
* Mapping Function == Full Associative
* Replacement Algorithm == Most Recently Used (MRU)
* Read Policy == Non-Load-Through
* Cache Access Time == 1 ns
* Memory Access Time == User Input
* Block Size (in words) == User Input
* Main Memory Size (either words or blocks) == User Input
* Cache Memory Size (either words or blocks) == User Input
* Program Flow (either words or blocks) == User Input

## How the Application Works
1. Input Memory Access Time.
2. Input Block Size.
3. Input Main Memory Size (choose either words or blocks).
4. Input Cache Memory Size (choose either words or blocks).
5. Input Program Flow (comma separated and choose either words or blocks).
6. Click the "Simulate" to generate results - Hits, Misses, Miss Penalty, Average Access Time, and Total Memory Access Time.
